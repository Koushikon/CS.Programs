    "A `sealed` class, in `C#`, is a class that cannot be inherited by any class but can be instantiated.\n",
    "\n",
    "The design intent of a sealed class is to indicate that the class is specialized and there is no need to extend it to provide any additional functionality through inheritance to override its behavior. A sealed class is often used to encapsulate a logic that needs to be used across the program but without any alteration to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "A `sealed` class is mostly used for security reasons by preventing unintended derivation by which the derived class may corrupt the implementation provided in the sealed class. As the sealed class cannot form a base class, calls to sealed classes are slightly faster because they enable certain runtime optimizations such as invocation of virtual member functions on instances of sealed class into non-virtual invocations. Sealed class helps in versioning by not breaking compatibility while changing a class from sealed type to unsealed.\n",
