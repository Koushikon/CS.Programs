[Source][link0001]

This project implements BreakFast problem and approaches the `Asynchronous` topic through a BreakFast analogy. These instructions are given to prepare a breakfast. Now how should we handle that throught traditional `Synchronoud` approach or `Asynchronous` approach. Which makes more sence and less time to prepare. Here Asynchronous version are implemented and `Breakfast` implements Synchronous version:

- Pour a cup of coffee.
- Heat a pan, then fry two eggs.
- Fry three slices of bacon.
- Toast two pieces of bread.
- Add butter and jam to the toast.
- Pour a glass of orange juice.
